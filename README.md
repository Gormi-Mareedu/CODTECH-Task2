**Mentor**: Muzammil  


### Overview:
This project, developed during my internship at CodTech IT Solutions under the mentorship of Muzammil, focuses on creating two essential Java applications: a **Simple Calculator** and a **Student Grade Tracker**.

1. **Simple Calculator**: A basic calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation, then outputs the calculated result.

2. **Student Grade Tracker**: This program helps track student grades across various subjects or assignments. It allows the user to input grades, calculates the average, and displays the overall performance in terms of letter grade or GPA, offering a simple solution for managing academic performance.


### Project Name: **Java Essentials: Calculator & Grade Tracker**

### Objective:
To develop effective and user-friendly Java applications that perform essential calculations and facilitate student grade tracking.

### Key Activities:
- Creating a basic calculator for simple arithmetic operations.
- Developing a grade tracking system that calculates averages and displays letter grades or GPA.
- Implementing user input handling and validation.
- Ensuring accuracy in computations and displaying results clearly.

### Key Insights:
- **Modularity**: The project emphasizes breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more manageable modules, such as separating calculator operations and grade computations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Focusing on making both applications easy to use, with intuitive prompts for user input and clear feedback on results.
- **Data Validation**: Implementing proper checks to ensure valid inputs, particularly for division operations in the calculator (e.g., handling division by zero) and valid grade entries in the grade tracker.
- **Reusability**: The code structure allows easy modification and expansion, such as adding new mathematical operations to the calculator or extending the grading scale in the tracker.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Programming Language**
