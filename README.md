### Overview:
The **Student Grade Tracker** is a Java application designed to help users manage and track student grades across various subjects or assignments. It allows the user to input individual grades, calculates the average, and provides an overall performance evaluation. The program also offers additional insights, such as converting numerical grades into letter grades or GPA, offering a simple yet effective way for students, teachers, or institutions to monitor academic performance.

### Project Name: **Student Grade Tracker**

### Objective:
To create a streamlined Java-based application that allows users to input and manage student grades efficiently, calculates the average performance, and outputs the final grade in both numerical and letter format, along with a GPA estimation.

### Key Activities:
- **Input Handling**: Allow users to input student names, subjects, and grades for various assignments or exams.
- **Grade Calculation**: Compute the average grade for each student based on the inputted values.
- **Grade Display**: Display the overall grade, both as a numerical value and a corresponding letter grade or GPA.
- **Feedback**: Provide additional feedback to the user, such as suggestions for improvement or congratulations for excellent performance.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure that the grades entered are valid and handle errors such as missing or out-of-range values.

### Key Insights:
- **Customizability**: The grade tracker can easily be adapted to various grading systems, such as percentage-based grading or GPA scales, making it versatile across different educational systems.
- **User-Friendly**: The user interface ensures that input is simple, with clear prompts for the user to follow, and results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Modular Design**: The program is designed to be modular, allowing the easy addition of new features, such as tracking attendance, providing grade trends over time, or generating performance reports.
- **Accuracy**: Ensuring that calculations, particularly average grades and GPA, are precise to give reliable academic performance insights.
- **Flexibility**: The program can be extended to manage multiple students at once or store historical data for analysis.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Programming Language**
